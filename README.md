- Discover Popular, Top Rated and Now Playing movies on TMDb.
- View movie details like release date, rating, tagline and overview inside the app.
- Discover popular, Top Rated, on TV and Airing today TV shows.
- view Tv show details like release date, rating, tagline and overview inside the app.

## Architecture and Tech features⭐
- Fully written in Kotlin language.
- Built on MVVM architecture pattern.
- Uses Android Architecture Components, specifically ViewModel and LiveData.
- Uses Retrofit for making API calls.
- Uses Picasso for image loading.

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the  Environment Setup instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Configuration
In order to run this application, you need to get your own key from TMDb. You can do that by clicking [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).

After you get an API key, put that key in ```gradle.properties``` file as follows:
```
API_KEY=your_key_api
```
# TMDB IN REACT NATIVE 


This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
